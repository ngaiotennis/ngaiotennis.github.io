    We are a community and family friendly club where everyone is welcome!
    We offer tennis opportunities for those new to the game and just starting
    out through to those who wish to play Interclub (novice grade through
    to competitive grades). We support this development via professional coaching
    supplied by Evolve Coaching. Below is a summary of what we offer, however please
    feel free to contact us via email should you have any specific questions on:
    <a href="mailto:ngaiojnrtennis@gmail.com">ngaiojnrtennis@gmail.com</a>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Coaching for beginners/those new to tennis – 1 hour group coaching is held on
      Sunday mornings during Term 4 & Term 1, delivered by professional coaches from
      Evolve Coaching. These sessions are for those aged between 5-6 through to 11-12,
      who are generally grouped together by age and/or ability with around 10-12 children
      in each group. This coaching is designed to provide the skills and confidence to
      take a complete beginner through to interclub entry level (Novice grade).
    </li>
    <li>
      Interclub competition for Boys, Girls & Mixed teams usually from ages 10-17
      (includes weekly 1 hour team coaching sessions from Evolve Coaching held mid-week
      after school) – most grades play Sunday morning, with the Girls Novice grade on
      Saturday morning.
    </li>
    <li>
      We have racquets you can borrow before buying your own.
    </li>
    <li>
      We hold occasional Junior club nights (Fridays) during the summer as a chance for
      the kids (& parents) to come together in a relaxed social setting and to have some
      fun! This usually involves cranking up the BBQ with attendance via a gold coin
      donation to help cover costs.
    </li>
    <li>
      We hold an annual Ngaio Tennis Junior club champs (usually near the end of Term 1)
      with trophies up for grabs!
    </li>
    <li>
      Registration fees (which cover 12 months) are - $130 for up to 11 yr olds or $145 for 12 and over
      (includes Sunday coaching in Terms 4 &amp; 1); plus a further $120 for those wishing to play Interclub
      (includes a weekly coaching session after school once a week during Terms 4 &amp; 1). Second &amp;
      subsequent children from the same family receive a $20 discount on their membership.
    </li>
    <li>
      Junior members can also book & use the courts at times set aside for Juniors
      (when not already booked for regular activities), with this generally being
      Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm – refer the Bookings page for more detail.
