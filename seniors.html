  <h3>Using the Courts for Casual Play</h3>
  <p>
    Only Ngaio Tennis Club members can use the courts for casual play - the combination code to access
    the courts is provided with your membership pack. For evening play, up to 10pm, court floodlights are
    available.
  </p>
  <p>
    A court booking system is available for all members. Members can also play without a booking, but
    those who have booked a court via the website take precedence over members coming down to play
    without a booking.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ngaio Tennis WhatsApp group provides a platform to organise casual games with other club
    members, keep up to date with club activities, and find fill-in players for interclub teams.
  </p>
  <h3>Interclub Competitions</h3>
  <p>
    Interclub competitions run throughout the year. Ngaio Tennis Club currently has teams playing on the
    following days:
    <ul>
      <li>Monday morning Women’s (summer)</li>
      <li>Monday evening Men’s (summer)</li>
      <li>Tuesday evening Women’s (summer)</li>
      <li>Saturday morning Women’s (summer)</li>
      <li>Saturday afternoon Mixed (summer)</li>
      <li>Sunday afternoon Mixed (winter)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Players who join Ngaio Tennis Club with the interclub membership type are eligible to play for one or
    more interclub teams, and the club pays the entry fees and purchases the balls for these.
  </p>
  <h3>Ngaio Tennis Club Code of Conduct</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
      An acceptable standard of behaviour is always expected, both at the club and when representing
      the club in other competitions. This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t go behind or on to another court while other players are playing a point (wait until there is
        a break between points and move quickly across)</li>
        <li>Introduce yourself to the other player(s) on court before the match and thank them for the game
        at the end of the match.</li>
        <li>Don’t hit the ball back to your opponent if the serve is a fault (hit it into the net or leave it behind
        your end of the court).</li>
        <li>The server should call out the score after each point so the opponent can hear it. If you don’t
        hear the score when you are receiving, then - to avoid disputes escalating about the score - ask
        what it is.</li>
        <li>Players are responsible for calling all balls on their side of the net honestly and clearly. If you
        have a problem with an opponent’s call then you can ask them to confirm it, but always
        remember that it is their call and you need to abide by it.</li>
        <li>Quickly return any ball(s) lying at your end of the court to the server at the end of each point.</li>
        <li>The server should commence the serve when the receiver is ready and not before.</li>
        <li>Don’t do anything to distract your opponent from playing the point (e.g. calling out, talking).</li>
        <li>Don’t use obscene language, slam balls, or throw your racquet.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Only footwear with non-marking soles can be worn on courts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep the courts and clubrooms tidy and put all rubbish and recycling in the provided bins. Please
      be considerate about what you put in the bins – only clean and recyclable items in the recycling,
      and no smelly food scraps in the rubbish.
    </li>
  </ol>
